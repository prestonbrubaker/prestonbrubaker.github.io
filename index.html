            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A process to make a homemade PCB allows for the implementation of an endless number of home automation possiblilities, 
                and aesthetic upgrades. 
                With the age of LLMs upon us, it also can act as a vessel for rapidly made cutom programs and API calls for AI based processing 
                of information. Much trial and error has led us to develop a process that can be repeated for the implementation of PCBs in general
                from prototype to completion. Once the machine codes are made, the PCB can be easily manufactured at mild scale.

                I will use an example of an IoT Solar Power Management System I am making.

            <h2>Step 1: Designing the Circuit</h2>
            <p>First, it is necessary to design and develop the circuit and schematic. This process involves the use of a breadboard and the electronic modules with THT pins / breakout boards with THT pins.
            Development in this stage involves determining how you want to implement your idea, determining if it works, minimizing components, testing out a proof of concept program with any microcontrolers,
            ect.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Entering the Circuit to KiCad</h2>
            <p>The circuit needs to be entered first in the schematic editor. Each component needs to be assigned a footprint corresponding to the specific electronic component (e.g. 3mm or 5mm LED).
            The standard spacing for breadboards and THT components is 0.1 inches, or 2.54 mm. After the schematic is complete, expor to PCB Editor. Place the components and route the copper tracks.
            The copper tracks should be placed on the blue, behind layer, as they will be on the back of the PCB board relative to the components. Track widths should be set to 1.2mm, 
            though I have had success with 0.8mm and even somewhat below. Make sure to create an outer edge with the edge.cuts layer.

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: FreeCad</h2>
            <p>Using the KiCadStepUp library, import the KiCad PCB and the footprints. Select the bottom tracks and use the 2D to sketch tool.
            Run the macro below "Hole Remover" to remove all the circles around the holes. These lines will be engraved, so you do not want to cut around the holes and make it
            more difficult to solder. Next, a lot of touch up it typically needed. Using the sketch editor, ensure that the paths are all sufficient, and that any hole has at least
            some spacing of copper around it so it is possible to solder the pin. I try to make the radius around a given hole 2.0mm when possible. After the sketch is touched up, exit out of sketch editor,
            turn on the option to toggle Axis Cross. Flip both the PCB board and the sketch 180 degrees, and make sure it is near the origin. Have the sketch's z position be 0mm, and the PCB
            board should be at z=-1.6mm.
            <br><br>
            Next, Switch over to CAM, select both the part and the sketch, and create a job. Make sure you are using grbl for the processor in the output tab, and select the tools. You may use a commonly use a 0.8mm endmill bit, 1.2 endmill bit, and 20 degree v bit. The endmill bits
             also represent drill bits in FreeCad, so no need to also import those tools. Make the speed any high number. I usually cut at max speed.
                Select the sketch and create an engracing job. You should use the V bit, and do steps of 0.05mm for max depth of -.1mm.
            <br><br>
            After this, create a drilling job and select all the holes and add them. Usually this job uses the 0.8mm diameter endmill (drill bit will actually be used when machining).
            Some components may require 1.2mm instead.Use max depth of -1.7mm.
            When drilling, I reccomend first only plunging around 0.5mm into the part (you can set origin above the part some to do this), and then plunging the full depth on the second pass. Creating the pilot holes will help
             ensure that the thin drill bit is less likely to drift and cause the holes to be offset.
            <br><br>
            Finally, create a profiling job and use the 1.2mm endmill. The endmill will actually be used when machining. Select outside for the profiling, and add all the outer edges.
            Use a step of -0.05mm for max depth of -1.7mm.
            <br><br>
            Export all the jobs individually as .nc files. These will be used for machining.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Machining the PCB</h2>
            <p>Clamp the copper clad board to a wooden block of the same width and length. Connect a computer to the CNC router 
                (DO NOT USE A MICROSD CARD WITH THE INCLUDED CONTROLLER. WILL CAUSE MANY ERRORS.)
            Use bCNC to load the jobs and jogg the bit. The jobs should be done in the order of engraving, drilling, and then cutout of the PCB.</p>
