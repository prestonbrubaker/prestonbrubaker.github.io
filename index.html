            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A process to make a homemade PCB allows for the implementation of an endless number of home automation possiblilities, 
                and aesthetic upgrades. 
                With the age of LLMs upon us, it also can act as a vessel for rapidly made cutom programs and API calls for AI based processing 
                of information. Much trial and error has led us to develop a process that can be repeated for the implementation of PCBs in general
                from prototype to completion. Once the machine codes are made, the PCB can be easily manufactured at mild scale.

            <h2>Step 1: Designing the Circuit</h2>
            <p>First, it is necessary to design and develop the circuit and schematic. This process involves the use of a breadboard and the electronic modules with THT pins / breakout boards with THT pins.
            Development in this stage involves determining how you want to implement your idea, determining if it works, minimizing components, testing out a proof of concept program with any microcontrolers,
            ect.</p>
